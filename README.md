# Ketoconazole-Triazolam-DDI
Modeling of published clinical ketoconazole-triazolam DDI studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of the published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the ketoconazole model [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/15/2/679)] regarding the DDI with the CYP3A4 victim drug triazolam, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied triazolam model has been documented previously [[2](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library/blob/master/Triazolam/Triazolam_evaluation_report.pdf)]. For further details and documentation please refer to [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/15/2/679)].

## Version information

PK-Sim Version 11.0.
